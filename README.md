# Flashcard-Mania-V2
Flashcard mania is a flashcard program meant to help apply learned coding practices while also preparing developers for interviews/tests. 
V2 features integration of Spring Framework JDBC's to allow querying to a POSTGRES database that houses the flashcard questions. Also implemented a more apparent MVC design pattern.
